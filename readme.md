## FunBooksAndVideos e-commerce shop 

Jordan Beard's FunBooksAndVideos e-commerce shop uses clean architecture to meet the requirements FunBooksAndVideos e-commerce shop. Sadly I didn't have quite enough have as much time to make it as shiny as I would like. 
I have a number of ideas on how this could be improved -  

- Unit & integration testing.
- Improve validation to collect all errors before returning an error response.
- Validation - check the products provided products are unique.
- Add proper data layer.
- Add additional endpoints for other entities - Product, Membership & Customer.
- Add global exception handler.
- Add logging.
- Spread out PurchaseOrderProcessor logic a bit more.
- Add mappers.
